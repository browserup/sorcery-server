I want to imagine the link-sharing process for the url version of the protocol. 
As an easy on-ramp, instead of the conversion of srcuri.com# links in our usual format, we could also allow just pasting github/gitlab URI's to initiate a srcuri.
We could either auto-convert, or redirect.

Use-case: User is in IDE, and share's a link with another user.

We can offer plugins for the major IDE's, but it would be better if the on-ramp was easier and didn't have a plugin or installation
as a pre-requisite for sharing or making a link. The lower the barriers to entry, the better.
We can also think through how to make a link from a github or gitlab path:

https://github.com/browserup/browserup/blob/f41ccd0b6a4ec5d964ac26377c66e34973e3581a/web/app/models/metric_set.rb#L43

now, just prefixing it with srcuri.com# is about as ideal a pitch as I can imagine for getting developers to use the site/syntax.
However, that means in some cases, like with line numbers, there are two anchors (#) in this string. What will happen in that

srcuri.com#https://github.com/browserup/browserup/blob/f41ccd0b6a4ec5d964ac26377c66e34973e3581a/web/app/models/metric_set.rb#L43

This is a brilliant growth hack. It lowers the barrier to entry to effectively zero for the sender. They don't need your tool installed; they just need to know the "magic trick."
Services like archive.is (prefix any URL to archive it) or 12ft.io (remove paywalls) have proven that users love this "URL hacking" pattern because it feels like a power-user move.

Here is the breakdown of how to handle the "Double Anchor" problem, the technical implementation, and why this specific user flow is so powerful.
1. The "Double Anchor" Issue
   You asked: What happens with srcuri.com#https://...#L43?

The Good News: Browsers are very predictable here. When a browser parses a URL, everything after the first # is treated as a single string (the fragment identifier). The browser does not try to recursively parse anchors.

If a user navigates to: https://srcuri.com#https://github.com/user/repo/blob/main/file.rb#L43

Your JavaScript on srcuri.com will see:

JavaScript
window.location.hash
// Returns: "#https://github.com/user/repo/blob/main/file.rb#L43"
It treats the second # as just another character in the string. This is perfect for you. You simply strip the leading #, and you are left with the full, valid target URL to parse.

2. The "Magic Prefix" Workflow
   This enables a "Zero-Install" sharing loop.

Scenario:

Alice (Does not have your tool) wants to link Bob (Has your tool) to a specific line of code.
Alice is on GitHub in Chrome. She clicks line 43. The URL updates.
She copies the URL.
She goes to Slack and types srcuri.com# (or your chosen domain) and pastes the link.
The Link: https://srcuri.com#https://github.com/browserup/browserup/.../metric_set.rb#L43

The Execution (The JS on srcuri.com):

Ingest: The page loads. The JS reads window.location.hash.
Detect: It sees the payload starts with http rather than a standard srcuri ID.
Parse: You write a lightweight "URL Parser" (regex or URL object) that extracts the metadata from the pasted GitHub string:
Origin: github.com + browserup/browserup

Ref/SHA: f41ccd...
Path: web/app/models/metric_set.rb
Line: 43
Construct: The JS constructs the internal protocol link: srcuri://open?url=https://github.com/browserup... (or your specific parameter format).
Redirect:

If Bob has the tool: The browser prompts to open the app. He lands right in his IDE.

If Bob (or Alice) clicks it without the tool: The redirect fails (or times out), and your page falls back to: "Viewing on GitHub..." and redirects them to the original https:// link they pasted.

3. A Better Syntax for Slack/Jira (The Path Strategy)
   There is one "gotcha" with the hash strategy (#).

Slack, Jira, and Teams "linkifiers" (the code that turns text into blue clickable links) can be finicky. If a user types srcuri.com# and then pastes a URL, the chat app might treat them as two separate strings because of the # or if there is a space.

The Robust Alternative: Path Prefixing

Instead of #, support a path-based prefix.
The Link: https://srcuri.com/https://github.com/browserup/browserup/...

Why this is safer:
Linkifiers love it: Chat apps see one long continuous string starting with http. They will almost always linkify the whole thing correctly.

Server-Side Smarts: Because this is a path (not a hash), your server (Nginx/Node) actually sees the request.
This allows you to generate Open Graph (OG) Meta Tags dynamically.

When the link is pasted in Slack, instead of a generic "Srcuri" preview, the server can fetch the GitHub details and render a preview card: "metric_set.rb:43 (BrowserUp)".

4. Summary of the Viral Loop
   This completes your ecosystem.
   User Type	Action	Link Format	Outcome
   IDE User	Uses Plugin	srcuri.com/open#path=...	Cleanest, precise context.
   Web User	"Hacks" URL	srcuri.com/https://github.com...	Zero friction. Works instantly.
   Receiver	Has Tool	(Either Link)	Opens in IDE.
   Receiver	No Tool	(Either Link)	Opens in GitHub (with "Get the App" banner).
   Next Step: Would you like me to mock up the TypeScript/JavaScript logic for that "Universal Git URL Parser" that can take a raw GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket URL and extract the repo, file, branch, and line?

For the ecosystem, there are some more nuances I'd like you to help me think-through. Now, I have several different "formats." I'm wondering which I should lean on the most, and when to push users toward each:

Remote URL Format:
Advantage: Contains the info with the remote, the workspace (repo) and all the path, file, and line number:

For https://github.com/browserup/browserup/blob/f41ccd0b6a4ec5d964ac26377c66e34973e3581a/web/app/models/metric_set.rb#L42
pnm.srcuri.com/remote/github.com/browserup/browserup/blob/f41ccd0b6a4ec5d964ac26377c66e34973e3581a/web/app/models/metric_set.rb#L42

Easy immediate paste and entry into the system.
* lowers the barrier to entry, for easier virality
* ease-of-use when converting from source code web location to local link
* web format is instantly share-able and works in Slack, JIRA, Teams, etc
* great for sharing, and virality because the landing page for users without Sorcery provides a download link for Sorcery

Disadvantage:
* github specific
* only works with source code repos, and each source code repo must be maintained and updated.
* there are probably a good number of source repo hosts (gitlab, gitea, etc) and they have different syntaxes
* does not handle custom options we might add, like
* unclear how to construct the URL starting from a local source location

# Custom procotol:

srcuri://browserup/web/app/models/metric_set.rb#L42rev=f41ccd0b6a4ec5d964ac26377c66e34973e3581a?action=open

Advantages

* User can look the relative path in their IDE locally, and instantly know how to construct the link
* Tooling can build these protocol path links
* Can work without a github repo
* Works as a local protocol in IDE's without external calls

Disadvantages:
* Share-able, but because of the rules for likely sharing locations, this is handicapped (Slack, Teams, JIRA)
* Not great for virality

Srcuri URL format:

Same as custom format, but works over HTTPS, and you just switch the URL of the custom format to be prefixed, like:

srcuri.com/open/
srcuri.com/open/browserup/web/app/models/metric_set.rb#L42rev=f41ccd0b6a4ec5d964ac26377c66e34973e3581a?action=open

    * web format is instantly share-able and works in Slack, JIRA, Teams, etc

* must know our normal syntax (same as custom protocol below, but with a srcuri.com)
* great for sharing, and virality because the landing page for users without Sorcery provides a download link for Sorcery

This is the core architectural decision that defines your user experience. You are right to identify that these aren't just different strings; they represent different workflows.
The best way to think about this is not "which one do I choose," but rather "what is the lifecycle of a link?"

Here is the strategic framework to organize these formats.

1. The Hierarchy of Formats
   You should treat these formats as layers in a stack.

Layer 1: The Engine (Custom Protocol)
srcuri://open?url=...

Role: The internal communication language.
Usage: purely machine-to-machine. Your web landing page redirects to this. Your desktop app listens for this.
User Strategy: Users should rarely type this manually. They should rarely paste this in Slack (because it doesn't linkify). It is the hidden plumbing.

Layer 2: The Canonical Standard (The "Srcuri URL")
https://srcuri.com/open/github.com/browserup/browserup/blob/main/file.rb#L42

Role: The primary sharing format.
Usage: This is what your IDE plugins copy to the clipboard. This is what users paste into Jira/Slack.
Why:
It is HTTPS (linkifies everywhere).

It is vendor-agnostic (it relies on your schema, not GitHub's).
It is the "Safe Transport" for Layer 1.

Layer 3: The Viral On-Ramp (The "Remote Wrapper")
https://srcuri.com/remote/https://github.com/browserup/browserup/blob/...

Role: The acquisition hook.
Usage: This is for users who don't have your IDE plugin yet, or are browsing code on the web and want to quickly "sorcery-fy" a link.

Why: It requires zero setup. It teaches them that "Sorcery exists."

2. The "Golden Path" Workflow
   Here is how you should push users in your UI and documentation:

Scenario A: The Power User (Has Plugin)
Action: User is in VS Code. Right-clicks line 42. Selects "Copy Sorcery Link."
Result: The clipboard contains Layer 2 (The Srcuri URL).
https://srcuri.com/open/github.com/browserup/...

Reasoning: This is the most robust link. It allows your server to generate OpenGraph preview cards for Slack ("📄 metric_set.rb:42"), and it guarantees the recipient gets the landing page if they don't have the app.

Scenario B: The Web User (No Plugin)
Action: User is browsing GitHub. They want to open this file locally.
Result: They manually type srcuri.com/ in front of the URL bar.

https://srcuri.com/https://github.com/...

Reasoning: This detects the intent. Your server parses the GitHub URL, and redirects their browser immediately to Layer 2.

Input: srcuri.com/remote/https://github.com/...
Server Action: Parse URL -> Extract Owner/Repo/SHA -> Redirect to srcuri.com/open/...

Browser Action: Try to launch srcuri://

3. Addressing Your Concerns
   You raised valid disadvantages for the formats. Here is how to mitigate them.

Problem: The "Remote Wrapper" is vendor-specific (GitLab vs GitHub)
Solution: This is strictly an ingestion problem, not a protocol problem.

You write a parser on your server/frontend (JS) that uses Regex to identify common patterns (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Azure DevOps).
If recognized: Convert to your Canonical Standard (Layer 2) and proceed.

If NOT recognized (e.g. private Gitea): Redirect the user to a "Wizard" page.

"We don't recognize this URL format. Please paste the Git Clone URL and the file path manually."
Once they fill that out, you generate a Layer 2 link for them to share.

Problem: "Unclear how to construct the URL starting from a local source"
Solution: You cannot share a link to a local source in the web pro![img.png](img.png)tocol unless it has a remote counterpart.

If I link you to srcuri://open?path=/Users/steve/code/main.rb, that link is dead for you.
The Rule: To generate a shareable https://srcuri.com link, the local tool must resolve the current file to a Git Remote origin.

The Fallback: If the user has no remote (local scratchpad), the IDE plugin should say: "Cannot generate web link: No remote origin found. Copying local srcuri:// link instead." (This is fine for personal note-taking).

4. The Final Recommendation
   Do not force users to choose. Automate the convergence.

Primary Format: https://srcuri.com/open/...
This is your product's "native tongue."

The path should be: /open/<host>/<org>/<repo>/<path-to-file>.

This looks clean, professional, and standardizes the structure regardless of where the code lives.
The "Magic Trick" (Secondary): https://srcuri.com/https://github.com...

Market this heavily as a "tip" or "hack."
"Pro Tip: Add srcuri.com/ in front of any GitHub URL to open it instantly."
Crucially: This URL should redirect to the Primary Format in the address bar as soon as it loads. Don't keep the "remote" URL in the browser bar; normalize it.

Why this wins: It allows you to support every git host via the "Magic Trick" (eventually), while keeping your core link structure (Primary Format) clean and consistent for Slack and Jira integration.

Let's generate a list out, for github, gitlat, gitea, bitbucket, and any others of URLs that point to source code files, along with what we should extract from those URL.

https://github.com/ericbeland/ruby-packer/blob/master/.ruby-version#L1
converts to
srcuri://ruby-packer/blob/master/.ruby-version:1?branch=master

For each of these URLs, we should translate the URL to our custom protocol equivalent.

For example:
srcuri://ruby-packer/blob/master/.ruby-version:1?branch=master
and
https://github.com/ericbeland/ruby-packer/blob/ffi-update/Gemfile

We will use this list to implement a Rust module that does the following in srcuri Desktop.
I'd like to do this for github, gitlab, bitbucket, codeberg, gitea, and any other popular repos.
To make the desktop client (srcuri://) robust, it must act as a "Universal Translator." It needs to ingest any web link and normalize it into a standard structure that allows the local machine to find the file on the disk.

Here is the mapping specification for the Rust implementation, covering the major Git providers.

The Standardized srcuri Target Format
To make your Rust application effective, I recommend standardizing the Output to remove provider-specific artifacts (like blob, src, tree, or /-/).

Target Protocol Structure: srcuri://<repo_name>/<clean_file_path>:<line>?branch=<ref>&origin=<full_remote_url>

1. GitHub
   GitHub is the most straightforward but has two variations (blob for files, tree for directories).

Pattern: https://github.com/:owner/:repo/blob/:ref/:path#L:line

Sample Input: https://github.com/ericbeland/ruby-packer/blob/ffi-update/Gemfile#L10

Component	Extracted Value	Notes
Origin	github.com/ericbeland/ruby-packer	Used to match local git config remote.
Repo Name	ruby-packer	Used as the URI host/workspace hint.
Ref	ffi-update	The branch or SHA.
Clean Path	Gemfile	Crucial: Must strip /blob/:ref/ from the raw path.
Line	10	Remove L prefix.
Translated Output: srcuri://ruby-packer/Gemfile:10?branch=ffi-update&origin=github.com/ericbeland/ruby-packer

2. GitLab
   GitLab uses a separator /-/ which makes parsing reliable, but older versions might skip it. They also use blob for files.

Pattern: https://gitlab.com/:owner/:repo/-/blob/:ref/:path#L:line

Sample Input: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/models/user.rb#L50

Component	Extracted Value	Notes
Origin	gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab	Supports subgroups (e.g., group/subgroup/repo).
Repo Name	gitlab	The last segment of the project path.
Ref	master	Found after blob/.
Clean Path	app/models/user.rb	Strip /-/blob/master/.
Line	50	Remove L prefix.
Translated Output: srcuri://gitlab/app/models/user.rb:50?branch=master&origin=gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab

3. Bitbucket (Cloud)
   Bitbucket uses src instead of blob and a verbose hash format for lines.

Pattern: https://bitbucket.org/:owner/:repo/src/:ref/:path#lines-:line

Sample Input: https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/aui/src/master/src/less/aui-page-layout.less#lines-5

Component	Extracted Value	Notes
Origin	bitbucket.org/atlassian/aui
Repo Name	aui
Ref	master	Found after /src/.
Clean Path	src/less/aui-page-layout.less	Strip /src/master/.
Line	5	Parse from lines-5. Sometimes lines-5:10 (take first).
Translated Output: srcuri://aui/src/less/aui-page-layout.less:5?branch=master&origin=bitbucket.org/atlassian/aui

4. Gitea / Forgejo
   Gitea is similar to GitHub but usually uses src and explicit branch or commit segments in the URL.

Pattern: https://gitea.com/:owner/:repo/src/branch/:ref/:path#L:line

Sample Input: https://gitea.com/gitea/tea/src/branch/main/cmd/login.go#L24

Component	Extracted Value	Notes
Origin	gitea.com/gitea/tea
Repo Name	tea
Ref	main	Found after src/branch/ (or src/commit/).
Clean Path	cmd/login.go	Strip src/branch/main/.
Line	24	Remove L prefix.
Translated Output: srcuri://tea/cmd/login.go:24?branch=main&origin=gitea.com/gitea/tea

5. Azure DevOps (Bonus)
   Enterprise users will ask for this. It is query-param based, which actually makes it easier to parse.

Pattern: https://dev.azure.com/:org/:project/_git/:repo?path=/:path&version=GB:ref&line=:line

Sample Input: https://dev.azure.com/fabric/fabric-editor/_git/fabric?path=/src/index.ts&version=GBmain&line=12

Component	Extracted Value	Notes
Origin	dev.azure.com/fabric/fabric-editor/_git/fabric	Structure varies slightly by organization settings.
Repo Name	fabric
Ref	main	Strip GB (Git Branch) prefix from version.
Clean Path	src/index.ts	Explicitly in path param.
Line	12	Explicitly in line param.
Translated Output: srcuri://fabric/src/index.ts:12?branch=main&origin=...

rust Specification
Here is how you can structure this in your Rust project (src/url_parser.rs). This structure prepares you to handle the complexity of regex matching across different providers.

Rust
use url::Url;

#[derive(Debug, PartialEq)]
pub struct SrcuriTarget {
pub origin: String,     // github.com/user/repo
pub repo_name: String,  // repo
pub file_path: String,  // path/to/file.rb
pub branch: String,     // master, main, or SHA
pub line: Option<u32>,  // 42
}

impl SrcuriTarget {
// The output format: srcuri://repo/path:line?branch=x&origin=y
pub fn to_protocol_string(&self) -> String {
let line_part = match self.line {
Some(n) => format!(":{}", n),
None => "".to_string(),
};
format!(
"srcuri://{}/{}{}?branch={}&origin={}",
self.repo_name, self.file_path, line_part, self.branch, self.origin
)
}
}

pub trait GitProviderParser {
fn can_parse(&self, url: &str) -> bool;
fn parse(&self, url: &str) -> Result<SrcuriTarget, String>;
}

// Example of how you might implement GitHub parsing logic
pub struct GitHubParser;

impl GitProviderParser for GitHubParser {
fn can_parse(&self, url: &str) -> bool {
url.contains("github.com")
}

    fn parse(&self, url_str: &str) -> Result<SrcuriTarget, String> {
        let url = Url::parse(url_str).map_err(|e| e.to_string())?;
        
        // Logic to split path segments: 
        // /:owner/:repo/blob/:ref/:path
        let segments: Vec<&str> = url.path_segments().ok_or("No path")?.collect();
        
        if segments.len() < 4 {
            return Err("Invalid GitHub URL structure".into());
        }

        let owner = segments[0];
        let repo = segments[1];
        let _type = segments[2]; // "blob" or "tree"
        let branch = segments[3];
        let path = segments[4..].join("/"); // Reassemble the file path

        // Parse Fragment for Line Number (#L42)
        let line = url.fragment()
            .and_then(|f| f.strip_prefix("L"))
            .and_then(|n| n.parse::<u32>().ok());

        Ok(SrcuriTarget {
            origin: format!("github.com/{}/{}", owner, repo),
            repo_name: repo.to_string(),
            file_path: path,
            branch: branch.to_string(),
            line,
        })
    }
}
Instead of origin, can we call it "remote"

Yes, remote is actually a better, more precise term.

In Git, "origin" is just the default name for a remote, but a user might have named it upstream or company-fork. By using remote, you clearly indicate "this is the URL of the remote server," regardless of what the user calls it locally.

Here is the updated specification using remote instead of origin.

The Standardized srcuri Target Format
Target Protocol Structure: srcuri://<repo_name>/<clean_file_path>:<line>?branch=<ref>&remote=<full_remote_url>

Translated Output: srcuri://fabric/src/index.ts:12?branch=main&remote=dev.azure.com/fabric/fabric-editor/_git/fabric

Updated Rust Specification
Here is the updated Rust struct for src/url_parser.rs using the remote field.

Rust
use url::Url;

#[derive(Debug, PartialEq)]
pub struct SrcuriTarget {
pub remote: String,     // github.com/user/repo (Formerly 'origin')
pub repo_name: String,  // repo
pub file_path: String,  // path/to/file.rb
pub branch: String,     // master, main, or SHA
pub line: Option<u32>,  // 42
}

impl SrcuriTarget {
// The output format: srcuri://repo/path:line?branch=x&remote=y
pub fn to_protocol_string(&self) -> String {
let line_part = match self.line {
Some(n) => format!(":{}", n),
None => "".to_string(),
};
// Updated query param to 'remote='
format!(
"srcuri://{}/{}{}?branch={}&remote={}",
self.repo_name, self.file_path, line_part, self.branch, self.remote
)
}
}

// ... Parser implementations remain largely the same, just mapping to the new struct field.
ok, it seems like you defined one pattern per website. However, these websites have different URL patterns for viewing a branch, tag, or commit (rev). I'd like to enumerate them fully.

You are absolutely right. GitHub is "loose" (it treats branches, tags, and commits almost identically under /blob/), but other platforms like Gitea and Azure DevOps are very strict and explicit.

To write a robust Rust parser, you need to handle the specific Reference Type (Branch, Tag, or Commit SHA).

Here is the exhaustive enumeration of URL patterns for the major providers.

Core Concept: The ref Field
In the srcuri:// output, the branch parameter is technically a Git Reference.

If the URL is for a branch: branch=main

If the URL is for a tag: branch=v1.0.2

If the URL is for a commit: branch=f41ccd0...

Your Rust logic should extract the segment regardless of what type it is and pass it to the branch= parameter.

1. GitHub
   GitHub uses blob for files and tree for directories. It treats branches, tags, and SHAs identically in the URL structure.

Context	URL Pattern	Extraction Logic
Branch	.../blob/main/path/file.rb	Ref: main
Tag	.../blob/v1.0/path/file.rb	Ref: v1.0
Commit (SHA)	.../blob/8f3a2c/path/file.rb	Ref: 8f3a2c
Blame View	.../blame/main/path/file.rb	Ref: main (Treat blame as blob)
Parser Logic:

Look for /blob/ OR /blame/.

The next segment is the ref (branch/tag/SHA).

Everything after is the path.

2. GitLab
   GitLab is stricter. It injects a /-/ delimiter in modern URLs to prevent ambiguity between repo names and paths, but older URLs might lack it.

Context	URL Pattern	Extraction Logic
Branch	.../-/blob/main/path/file.rb	Ref: main
Tag	.../-/blob/v1.0/path/file.rb	Ref: v1.0
Commit (SHA)	.../-/blob/8f3a2c/path/file.rb	Ref: 8f3a2c
Blame	.../-/blame/main/path/file.rb	Ref: main
Raw	.../-/raw/main/path/file.rb	Ref: main
Parser Logic:

Look for /-/.

Look for blob, blame, or raw.

The next segment is the ref.

3. Gitea / Forgejo
   These are the most explicit. They tell you exactly what the reference type is in the URL path.

Context	URL Pattern	Extraction Logic
Branch	.../src/branch/main/path/file.go	Ref: main (Prefix: /src/branch/)
Tag	.../src/tag/v1.0/path/file.go	Ref: v1.0 (Prefix: /src/tag/)
Commit	.../src/commit/8f3a2c/path/file.go	Ref: 8f3a2c (Prefix: /src/commit/)
Legacy/Simple	.../src/main/path/file.go	Ref: main (If branch/tag/commit keyword is missing)
Parser Logic:

Check for /src/branch/, /src/tag/, or /src/commit/.

If found, the next segment is ref.

If not found (older Gitea), check for just /src/; the next segment is ref.

4. Bitbucket (Cloud)
   Bitbucket uses /src/ for everything.

Context	URL Pattern	Extraction Logic
Branch	.../src/main/path/file.ts	Ref: main
Tag	.../src/release-1.0/path/file.ts	Ref: release-1.0
Commit	.../src/8f3a2c/path/file.ts	Ref: 8f3a2c
Parser Logic:

Look for /src/.

The next segment is the ref.

Caution: Bitbucket refs can contain slashes (e.g., feature/login).

Strategy: Unlike GitHub, Bitbucket URLs usually don't "break" if you incorrectly split the path. However, the safest bet is to rely on the fact that the file path usually corresponds to a file on disk.

Alternative: Bitbucket often puts the SHA in the URL when you are browsing deeply. If the segment looks like a 40-char hex, it's a commit.

5. Azure DevOps
   Azure uses query parameters, which makes it the easiest to parse programmatically but "ugliest" to read.

Context	URL Pattern	Extraction Logic
Branch	...path=/file.cs&version=GBmain	Ref: main (Strip GB prefix)
Tag	...path=/file.cs&version=GTv1.0	Ref: v1.0 (Strip GT prefix)
Commit	...path=/file.cs&version=GC8f3a...	Ref: 8f3a... (Strip GC prefix)
Default	...path=/file.cs (No version param)	Ref: HEAD or main (Handle as optional)
Parser Logic:

Parse the query string.

Extract path.

Extract version.

Switch on the first two chars of version:

GB -> Branch

GT -> Tag

GC -> Commit

Else -> Raw Ref

Example of Complexity: Branch Names with Slashes
Scenario: A branch named feature/user-auth.

GitHub: github.com/org/repo/blob/feature/user-auth/app/models/user.rb

Problem: Is the ref feature and the path user-auth/...? Or is the ref feature/user-auth?

Solution: This is the classic GitHub ambiguity.

Rust Strategy: The desktop app implementation has an advantage. You can try to resolve the ref against the local git repo.

Try Ref: feature, Path: user-auth/app... -> Does feature exist in git show-ref?

Try Ref: feature/user-auth, Path: app... -> Does feature/user-auth exist?

Fallback: If you can't verify locally (pure string parsing), assume the ref is the first segment only unless you have specific heuristics. However, for the srcuri:// protocol, it is acceptable to pass the ambiguity to the desktop client to resolve.

Would you like to include the "Branch with Slashes" ambiguity resolution logic in the Rust spec, or keep it simple for V1?

Let's include it and recommend an approach.

This is the notorious "Slashing Ambiguity" problem in Git URLs.

Because / is a valid character in both branch names (feature/login) and file paths (src/main.rs), a URL segment like feature/login/src/main.rs is mathematically ambiguous without querying the actual Git repository.

Here is the recommended approach and the Rust implementation strategy.

The Strategy: "Heuristic Split with Local Verification"
Since this logic lives in your Desktop Client, you have a massive advantage: You have the local Git repo. You don't need to guess; you can ask Git.

We will implement a Sliding Window Resolver.

Step 1: Parse the "Blob" segment. Extract everything after /blob/ (or equivalent) as one giant raw string.

Raw: feature/user-auth/app/models/user.rb

Step 2: Heuristic Attempt (Fast Path). Check if the string contains common root directories (src, lib, bin). Split there first.

Step 3: Sliding Window (Robust Path). If heuristics fail (or we want 100% certainty), iterate through the slash positions from left to right. Check if the left side is a valid reference in the local git repo.

The Rust Implementation
Here is how to implement this in your url_parser module. This implementation assumes you have access to the local git repository (via the git2 crate or shell commands) to verify references.

1. The Ambiguity Resolver
   Rust
   use std::path::Path;
   // Assuming use of 'git2' crate for local repo interaction,
   // or you can use std::process::Command to call 'git show-ref'
   use git2::Repository;

pub struct GitUrlParser;

impl GitUrlParser {
/// The main entry point for GitHub/GitLab URLs
pub fn parse_blob_url(&self, raw_blob_segment: &str, repo_path: &Path) -> (String, String) {
// 1. Try to resolve against local git repo (The "Gold Standard")
if let Ok(repo) = Repository::open(repo_path) {
if let Some((branch, file)) = self.resolve_via_git(&repo, raw_blob_segment) {
return (branch, file);
}
}

        // 2. Fallback: If no local repo found (or we are in a web context),
        // use heuristics (The "Best Guess")
        self.resolve_via_heuristics(raw_blob_segment)
    }

    /// Iterates splits and checks if the 'branch' part exists in .git
    fn resolve_via_git(&self, repo: &Repository, raw: &str) -> Option<(String, String)> {
        // Split indices: "a/b/c" -> split at 1, split at 3...
        let slash_indices: Vec<_> = raw.match_indices('/').map(|(i, _)| i).collect();

        for idx in slash_indices {
            let potential_branch = &raw[0..idx];
            let potential_path = &raw[idx + 1..];

            // Check if 'potential_branch' is a valid ref (branch or tag)
            // git rev-parse --verify specific_ref
            if repo.find_reference(&format!("refs/heads/{}", potential_branch)).is_ok() 
               || repo.find_reference(&format!("refs/tags/{}", potential_branch)).is_ok() 
               // Also check for remote branches if local doesn't exist
               || repo.find_reference(&format!("refs/remotes/origin/{}", potential_branch)).is_ok() 
            {
                return Some((potential_branch.to_string(), potential_path.to_string()));
            }
        }
        
        // Edge case: formatting inputs where the filename is at root 
        // and the branch has no slashes is handled by the first loop or 
        // falls through if the branch itself doesn't exist locally.
        None
    }

    /// Uses a list of common top-level project folders to guess the split
    fn resolve_via_heuristics(&self, raw: &str) -> (String, String) {
        let common_roots = [
            "/src/", "/lib/", "/bin/", "/app/", "/test/", "/spec/", 
            "/docs/", "/cmd/", "/pkg/", "/.github/", "/README", "/Dockerfile"
        ];

        for root in common_roots {
            if let Some(idx) = raw.find(root) {
                // found a common root, split immediately before it
                let branch = &raw[0..idx];
                // +1 to skip the slash and keep the path clean
                let path = &raw[idx + 1..]; 
                return (branch.to_string(), path.to_string());
            }
        }

        // Fallback of last resort: Split at the FIRST slash.
        // Most branches don't have slashes, so this is the safest naive bet.
        match raw.split_once('/') {
            Some((b, p)) => (b.to_string(), p.to_string()),
            None => (raw.to_string(), "".to_string()), // No path, just branch (e.g. checking out root)
        }
    }
}
How to Integrate This
Web Context (No Local Repo): When your website srcuri.com parses the link in the browser (JS/WASM), it must use the resolve_via_heuristics method. It cannot know for sure.

Risk: It might generate a link where branch=feature/user and path=auth when it should be branch=feature and path=user/auth.

Mitigation: The Desktop App should be "forgiving." If it receives a request and can't find the file, it should try shifting the slash one position left or right to see if that fixes it.

Desktop Context (App): The Desktop App receives the ambiguous raw string (or the heuristically parsed one). It should immediately run resolve_via_git to "true up" the request before opening the IDE.

Updated Extraction Logic for URLs
You must update the parser logic (from previous step) to grab the Full Tail instead of splitting eagerly.

GitHub Example:

Input: https://github.com/org/repo/blob/feature/new/ui/src/main.rs

Old Logic: Split at 4th slash -> Branch: feature, Path: new/ui/src/main.rs. (WRONG)

New Logic:

Identify base: https://github.com/org/repo/blob/

Extract Tail: feature/new/ui/src/main.rs

Pass Tail to resolve_via_git() or resolve_via_heuristics().

Summary Recommendation
Adopt the "Tail Extraction" pattern. Don't try to parse branch/path via Regex alone. Extract the whole substring after /blob/ (or /src/).

Implement "Sliding Window" resolution in the Rust client using the git2 crate.

Use "Common Folder" heuristics for the JavaScript/Web parser to get 95% accuracy on the generate link, knowing the Desktop App will auto-correct the last 5% using the local Git database.

Can we use file existence? If we have a rev, we can switch first, then just go to the file if it exists?

Yes, using file existence as the validator is actually the most robust strategy. It eliminates the need for "magic" heuristics or guessing common folder names like src.

However, there is a catch to your specific phrasing: You cannot "Switch first" because you don't know what string to switch to yet.

If the URL tail is feature/login/user.rb, and you try to git checkout feature/login/user.rb, Git will fail. You must identify that the branch is feature/login and the file is user.rb before you can perform the checkout.

Here is the refined strategy: "Probe, Resolve, Then Switch."

The "Probing" Strategy
Instead of guessing, we loop through the string and ask Git two questions for every possible split point:

"Is the left side a valid Reference (Branch/Tag/SHA)?"

If yes: "Does the right side exist as a file inside that Reference?"

Only when both are true do we have our match.

Why this is safer
Using this method allows you to verify the path without touching the user's working directory. You use "Git Plumbing" commands to look into the database. If you physically tried to checkout to test every possibility, it would be slow and could mess up the user's uncommitted work.

The Rust Implementation (git2 style)
Here is how you implement this logic in Rust. This function takes the ambiguous "tail" string and returns the separated (Branch, Path).

Rust
use git2::{Repository, ObjectType};
use std::path::Path;

pub fn resolve_ambiguous_tail(repo_path: &Path, raw_tail: &str) -> Option<(String, String)> {
let repo = Repository::open(repo_path).ok()?;

    // 1. Get all slash positions to try splitting
    let slash_indices: Vec<_> = raw_tail.match_indices('/').map(|(i, _)| i).collect();

    // 2. Iterate through possible split points
    for idx in slash_indices {
        let candidate_ref = &raw_tail[0..idx]; // e.g., "feature/login"
        let candidate_file = &raw_tail[idx + 1..]; // e.g., "app/models/user.rb"

        // Step A: Does the Reference exist?
        // We try to resolve it as a branch, tag, or remote branch.
        let object = match repo.revparse_single(candidate_ref) {
            Ok(obj) => obj,
            Err(_) => continue, // Not a valid branch/tag, keep looking
        };

        // Step B: Does the File exist INSIDE that Reference?
        // We look up the tree of that specific commit.
        if let Ok(tree) = object.peel_to_tree() {
             // get_path checks if the file exists in that specific tree structure
            if tree.get_path(Path::new(candidate_file)).is_ok() {
                // MATCH FOUND!
                return Some((candidate_ref.to_string(), candidate_file.to_string()));
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Edge Case: If the tail has NO slashes, or the file is at root
    // You might want to handle "main/README.md" where split is at index 4.
    None
}
The Logic Flow
Let's trace feature/login/user.rb where the branch is feature/login:

Iteration 1: Split at first slash.

Ref: feature

File: login/user.rb

Check: Does branch feature exist? Maybe.

If Yes: Does login/user.rb exist in feature? No.

Result: Continue.

Iteration 2: Split at second slash.

Ref: feature/login

File: user.rb

Check: Does branch feature/login exist? Yes.

If Yes: Does user.rb exist in feature/login? Yes.

Result: Success. Return ("feature/login", "user.rb").

Handling the "Action"
Once this function returns the correct pair, then you proceed with the user-facing action:

Stash Changes (Optional/Configurable, if user has dirty working tree).

Checkout the resolved branch: git checkout feature/login.

Launch Editor opening the resolved path: code user.rb.

This approach is deterministic and 100% accurate to the actual repo state.

We're not checking out files, we'll be checking out a branch, tag, etc for the repo. We'll use worktrees if needed.

This is a crucial distinction. Using Git Worktrees transforms the user experience from "potentially destructive" (messing with their current workspace) to "additive" (opening a parallel workspace). It makes the tool significantly safer and more professional.

However, the parsing logic remains the same: You still must identify the branch name before you can create a worktree for it.

You cannot run git worktree add ../new-folder feature/login/app/main.rb. Git will reject that branch name. You must first derive that the branch is feature/login and the file is app/main.rb.

Here is the updated Logic Flow and Rust Strategy incorporating Worktrees.

The "Safe Switch" Logic Flow
We separate the process into two phases: Resolution (What am I looking for?) and Execution (How do I get there?).

Phase 1: Resolution (The Parser)
This remains the same. We take the URL tail (feature/login/app/user.rb) and use the "Probing Strategy" to ask the local Git repo:

Is feature a branch? (No)

Is feature/login a branch? (Yes)

Result: Target Branch = feature/login, Target File = app/user.rb.

Phase 2: Execution (The Worktree Decision Engine)
Now that we know the Target Branch is feature/login, we decide how to access it based on the user's current state.

Current State	Condition	Action
Already there	User is on feature/login	Open Editor immediately.
Clean Workspace	User is on main, git status is clean	git checkout feature/login -> Open Editor.
Dirty Workspace	User has uncommitted changes	Create Worktree. Don't touch current files.
Conflict	Target branch is checked out in another worktree	reuse that existing worktree -> Open Editor.
The Rust Implementation Strategy
Here is how you structure this in Rust using git2.

1. The Resolver (Same as before)
   Identifies the split point.

Rust
// (Simplified from previous step)
fn resolve_target(repo: &Repository, ambiguous_tail: &str) -> Option<(String, String)> {
// Returns ("feature/login", "app/user.rb")
// ... logic verifying ref exists and file exists inside ref ...
}
2. The Executioner (The Worktree Logic)
   Decides whether to switch or create a worktree.

Rust
use git2::{Repository, BranchType, WorktreeAddOptions};
use std::path::{Path, PathBuf};
use std::process::Command;

pub struct OpenRequest {
pub repo_path: PathBuf,
pub target_branch: String,
pub target_file: String,
}

pub fn handle_open_request(req: OpenRequest) -> Result<(), String> {
let repo = Repository::open(&req.repo_path).map_err(|e| e.to_string())?;

    // 1. Check if we are ALREADY on the target branch
    let head = repo.head().ok();
    let current_branch = head.as_ref().and_then(|h| h.shorthand());

    if current_branch == Some(&req.target_branch) {
        println!("Already on branch. Opening file...");
        return open_editor(&req.repo_path, &req.target_file);
    }

    // 2. Check for Dirty State (Simplified)
    let is_dirty = repo.statuses(None).map(|s| !s.is_empty()).unwrap_or(true);

    if !is_dirty {
        // CASE A: Workspace is clean. Safe to checkout.
        println!("Workspace clean. Checking out {}...", req.target_branch);
        
        // Standard git checkout logic
        let (object, reference) = repo.revparse_ext(&req.target_branch).map_err(|e| e.to_string())?;
        repo.checkout_tree(&object, None).map_err(|e| e.to_string())?;
        repo.set_head(reference.name().unwrap()).map_err(|e| e.to_string())?;
        
        return open_editor(&req.repo_path, &req.target_file);
    } else {
        // CASE B: Workspace is dirty. USE WORKTREE.
        println!("Workspace dirty. Creating worktree for {}...", req.target_branch);
        return setup_and_open_worktree(&repo, &req);
    }
}

fn setup_and_open_worktree(repo: &Repository, req: &OpenRequest) -> Result<(), String> {
// 1. Define where worktrees live (e.g., parallel folder or .worktrees inside)
// Strategy: Create a folder named after the branch hash to avoid collisions
let safe_dir_name = req.target_branch.replace("/", "-");
let worktree_path = req.repo_path.join(".srcuri_worktrees").join(&safe_dir_name);

    // 2. Check if worktree already exists for this branch
    if worktree_path.exists() {
         println!("Worktree already exists. Reusing...");
         return open_editor(&worktree_path, &req.target_file);
    }

    // 3. Create the Worktree
    // Corresponds to: git worktree add .srcuri_worktrees/feature-login feature/login
    let mut opts = WorktreeAddOptions::new();
    let ref_to_checkout = repo.find_branch(&req.target_branch, BranchType::Local)
        .or_else(|_| repo.find_branch(&req.target_branch, BranchType::Remote))
        .map_err(|_| "Branch not found")?;
        
    // Note: git2 worktree support can be complex; specific implementation details 
    // depend on version, but logically this is the step.
    repo.worktree(
        &safe_dir_name, 
        &worktree_path, 
        Some(opts)
    ).map_err(|e| e.to_string())?;

    // 4. Open Editor in the NEW path
    open_editor(&worktree_path, &req.target_file)
}

fn open_editor(root_path: &Path, file_path: &str) -> Result<(), String> {
let full_path = root_path.join(file_path);

    // Launch VS Code (or user default)
    Command::new("code")
        .arg(full_path)
        .spawn()
        .map_err(|e| e.to_string())?;
        
    Ok(())
}
Key Advantages of this Approach
Zero Data Loss: Users never accidentally lose uncommitted code because you switched their branch automatically.

Context Preservation: The user can keep their "main" work open in one window, and view the "linked code" in a separate window (worktree).

Speed: If the worktree already exists (cached), opening it is instantaneous.

Housekeeping Note
If you use worktrees, your Desktop App might eventually need a "Cleanup" function to delete old .srcuri_worktrees/ folders that haven't been used in a while, otherwise the user's disk usage will grow indefinitely.

We have two different execution contexts, though. There's the server, which must calculate the srcuri:// without knowing what files are where.



The calculations you're talking about are all going to take place in the srcuri Desktop app, not the server app. I think our"translator" will live in the server app.

You are absolutely right. I was conflating the two steps.

This separation of concerns actually simplifies the architecture:

The Server (The Translator): It is "blind." It doesn't know if feature/login is a branch or a folder. It simply parses text strings. Its job is to convert a messy HTTP URL into a structured srcuri:// link.

The Desktop (The Resolver): It has the "eyes" (the local git repo). It takes the structure from the server and figures out the truth.

Here is the specification for the Server-Side Translator.

The Protocol Contract: "The Naive Split"
Since the server cannot know where the branch name ends and the file path begins, we must agree on a standard rule for how the server constructs the link.

The Rule: The Server will always parse the First Segment after the "magic token" (blob, src, etc.) as the branch, and everything else as the path.

Input: .../blob/feature/login/app/main.rb

Server Output: branch=feature, path=login/app/main.rb

Desktop Responsibility: The Desktop app knows the server uses this "Naive Split." It will check if branch feature exists. If not, it will start shifting slashes to the right (feature/login) until it finds the match.

The Server-Side Translator Specification
Here is exactly how your Server (Node, Go, Rust, etc.) should process URLs from the major providers to generate the srcuri:// link.

1. GitHub
   URL: https://github.com/ericbeland/ruby-packer/blob/feature/update/Gemfile#L10

Extraction Regex: github\.com/([^/]+)/([^/]+)/blob/([^/]+)/(.+)

Group 1 (Owner): ericbeland
Group 2 (Repo): ruby-packer
Group 3 (Ref - Naive): feature
Group 4 (Path - Rest): update/Gemfile

Anchor: L10 -> 10

Constructed Link: srcuri://ruby-packer/update/Gemfile:10?branch=feature&remote=github.com/ericbeland/ruby-packer

2. GitLab
   URL: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/release/15-0/app/models/user.rb#L50

Extraction Regex: gitlab\.com/([^/]+)/([^/]+)/-/blob/([^/]+)/(.+)

3. Bitbucket (Cloud)

Anchor: lines-5 -> 5

Constructed Link: srcuri://aui/header-fix/src/less/main.less:5?branch=bugfix&remote=bitbucket.org/atlassian/aui

4. Gitea / Forgejo (The Exception)
   Because Gitea URLs are explicit (/src/branch/...), the server can actually do a Perfect Split.

URL: https://gitea.com/gitea/tea/src/branch/feature/login/cmd/main.go#L24

Logic:

Detect /src/branch/ or /src/commit/.

Unlike the others, Gitea does not combine them. However, URLs often do allow slashes in branch names here without encoding.

Safe Bet: Treat it like GitHub (Naive Split) to keep the protocol consistent. Let the desktop do the work.

Constructed Link: srcuri://tea/login/cmd/main.go:24?branch=feature&remote=gitea.com/gitea/tea

The "Universal Translator" Implementation (TypeScript Example)
If your server is Node/TS (common for web redirectors), here is the logic. This produces the srcuri:// string ready for redirection.

TypeScript
interface ParsedInfo {
remote: string;
repo: string;
naiveBranch: string;
naivePath: string;
line?: string;
}

function generateSrcuri(webUrl: string): string | null {
const url = new URL(webUrl);
const pathSegments = url.pathname.split('/').filter(p => p.length > 0);
const hash = url.hash; // e.g. #L10 or #lines-5

let info: ParsedInfo | null = null;

// 1. GitHub Strategy
if (url.hostname === 'github.com') {
// path: /owner/repo/blob/naiveBranch/rest/of/path
if (pathSegments[2] === 'blob' || pathSegments[2] === 'tree') {
info = {
remote: `github.com/${pathSegments[0]}/${pathSegments[1]}`,
repo: pathSegments[1],
naiveBranch: pathSegments[3], // The Naive Split
naivePath: pathSegments.slice(4).join('/'),
line: parseLine(hash, 'L')
};
}
}

// 2. GitLab Strategy
else if (url.hostname === 'gitlab.com') {
// path: /owner/repo/-/blob/naiveBranch/rest/of/path
const blobIndex = pathSegments.indexOf('blob');
if (blobIndex > -1 && pathSegments[blobIndex - 1] === '-') {
info = {
remote: `gitlab.com/${pathSegments[0]}/${pathSegments[1]}`,
repo: pathSegments[1],
naiveBranch: pathSegments[blobIndex + 1],
naivePath: pathSegments.slice(blobIndex + 2).join('/'),
line: parseLine(hash, 'L')
};
}
}

// 3. Bitbucket Strategy
else if (url.hostname === 'bitbucket.org') {
// path: /owner/repo/src/naiveBranch/rest/of/path
if (pathSegments[2] === 'src') {
info = {
remote: `bitbucket.org/${pathSegments[0]}/${pathSegments[1]}`,
repo: pathSegments[1],
naiveBranch: pathSegments[3],
naivePath: pathSegments.slice(4).join('/'),
line: parseLine(hash, 'lines-')
};
}
}

if (!info) return null;

// Construct the Protocol Link
// srcuri://repo/path:line?branch=b&remote=r
let dest = `srcuri://${info.repo}/${info.naivePath}`;
if (info.line) dest += `:${info.line}`;

const params = new URLSearchParams();
params.set('branch', info.naiveBranch);
params.set('remote', info.remote);

return `${dest}?${params.toString()}`;
}

function parseLine(hash: string, prefix: string): string | undefined {
if (!hash) return undefined;
const clean = hash.replace('#', '');
if (clean.startsWith(prefix)) {
// handle ranges like L10-L12, just take 10
return clean.replace(prefix, '').split('-')[0];
}
return undefined;
}
Why this is better for the Ecosystem
Server is Lightweight: The server logic is basically simple string manipulation. It processes in microseconds.

Forward Compatible: If you add support for a new host (e.g., Azure DevOps), you just add a new regex to the server. The Desktop App doesn't technically need an update because it just receives a remote, branch, and path and does its standard git lookup.

Handling "Main" vs "Master": By extracting the branch from the URL, you don't have to worry about default branch names. You just pass whatever the URL had.
